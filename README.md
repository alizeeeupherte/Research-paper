# Living by the river: what strategies for a submersible territory?

#### First of all, this work is supervised by my diploma director Mr. Marc HYMANS architect and engineer, my diploma president Mr. Gaston TOLILA rchitect and associate engineer of the Atelier d'Architecture Tolila + Gilliland, my expert Mr. Michel HOESSLER landscape architect Partner of TER agency, Mikael HALTER architect, Peggie Garcia architect and Ary Justman architect partner of Rotunno Justman architects.



The subject of area at risk of flooding in a fluvial environment seems to me to be an important issue in construction today because it affects an increasingly growing population in the world and in particular in Île-de-France. In France today 17 million people live in a flood zone. 9 million jobs are threatened by overflowing rivers. And global warming can expose populations to major risks. It is therefore urgent to reduce the vulnerability of the territories by adapting constructions to risks. The challenge is to find new ways of living by integrating this natural constraint. Controlling rising sea levels is becoming a necessity and must be integrated from the design of any project to reduce its impact because currently, the average annual cost linked to flooding represents 3.9 billion euros and this figure could reach the 5 billion euros in France by 2100.


Flood zones force the renewal of urban approaches. I'm going to be particularly interested in this study in urban river areas. So we can ask ourselves the questions how to reduce the vulnerability of neighborhoods affected by the floods? How to successfully combine regulation, adaptability, reversibility and innovation in architectural projects? How to build resilient architectures in the face of flood risk in the river environment?

First I studied the risk of flooding in Île-de-France, and in particular on the site of confluence between the Seine and the Marne grouping the municipalities of Ivry-sur-Seine, Charenton-le- Pont and d'Alfortville. And faced with the plight of the inhabitants and in view of the rising waters, it was important for me to propose a final study project providing alternatives for better living with water so that it is no longer experienced as a confrontation, a constraint, something negative.
