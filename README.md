# Living by the river: what strategies for a submersible territory?

#### First of all, this work is supervised by my diploma director Mr. Marc HYMANS architect and engineer, my diploma president Mr. Gaston TOLILA rchitect and associate engineer of the Atelier d'Architecture Tolila + Gilliland, my expert Mr. Michel HOESSLER landscape architect Partner of TER agency, Mikael HALTER architect, Peggie Garcia architect and Ary Justman architect partner of Rotunno Justman architects.



The subject of area at risk of flooding in a fluvial environment seems to me to be an important issue in construction today because it affects an increasingly growing population in the world and in particular in Île-de-France. In France today 17 million people live in a flood zone. 9 million jobs are threatened by overflowing rivers. And global warming can expose populations to major risks. It is therefore urgent to reduce the vulnerability of the territories by adapting constructions to risks. The challenge is to find new ways of living by integrating this natural constraint. Controlling rising sea levels is becoming a necessity and must be integrated from the design of any project to reduce its impact because currently, the average annual cost linked to flooding represents 3.9 billion euros and this figure could reach the 5 billion euros in France by 2100.


Flood zones force the renewal of urban approaches. I'm going to be particularly interested in this study in urban river areas. So we can ask ourselves the questions how to reduce the vulnerability of neighborhoods affected by the floods? How to successfully combine regulation, adaptability, reversibility and innovation in architectural projects? How to build resilient architectures in the face of flood risk in the river environment?

First I studied the risk of flooding in Île-de-France, and in particular on the site of confluence between the Seine and the Marne grouping the municipalities of Ivry-sur-Seine, Charenton-le- Pont and d'Alfortville. And faced with the plight of the inhabitants and in view of the rising waters, it was important for me to propose a final study project providing alternatives for better living with water so that it is no longer experienced as a confrontation, a constraint, something negative.

In a second part, I explain, through the architectural project, how it is possible to link urban life and river water through architectural arrangements that make it possible to cope with the floods in an intelligent manner on an urban scale and then on a plot scale.

_Build on stilts: First there is the upper enclosure and then the stilts. Building at height has the advantage of adapting to many topographical and geographical conditions and in particular makes it possible to reduce the danger faced with floods._

_The floating structure: The floating structure is mounted on an aluminum platform with hard plastic floats._

_The amphibious house: The lower part of the house lies flat on a tray. In the event of rising water, thanks to the buoyancy of the archimedes the water will slide under the house towards the basin, which will make the house go up, maintained by rails. The house is moored, the electrical conduits and conduits follow the movement of the water._



This research was an opportunity for me to increase my knowledge of resilient projects in a fluvial environment to better live in a flood area like in Ile-de-France.
With the evolution of factors like that of global warming, I understood that the context in which we develop our strategies requires permanent adaptation.
Through my final project, I want to integrate resilient developments at the urban scale as well as at the scale of the individual plot to allow an optimization of the built landscape in times of floods. I want to increase the safety of populations exposed to rising water levels by providing residents with a mixed program, complementary to the existing and innovative around smart urban infrastructure.
