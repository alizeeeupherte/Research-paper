# Living by the river: what strategies for a submersible territory?



The subject of area at risk of flooding in a fluvial environment seems to me to be an important issue in construction today because it affects an increasingly growing population in the world and in particular in Île-de-France. In France today 17 million people live in a flood zone. 9 million jobs are threatened by overflowing rivers. And global warming can expose populations to major risks. It is therefore urgent to reduce the vulnerability of the territories by adapting constructions to risks. The challenge is to find new ways of living by integrating this natural constraint. Controlling rising sea levels is becoming a necessity and must be integrated from the design of any project to reduce its impact because currently, the average annual cost linked to flooding represents 3.9 billion euros and this figure could reach the 5 billion euros in France by 2100.


Flood zones force the renewal of urban approaches. I'm going to be particularly interested in this study in urban river areas. So we can ask ourselves the questions how to reduce the vulnerability of neighborhoods affected by the floods? How to successfully combine regulation, adaptability, reversibility and innovation in architectural projects? How to build resilient architectures in the face of flood risk in the river environment?


First of all, I explain, through the architectural project, how it is possible to link urban life and river water through architectural arrangements that make it possible to cope with the floods in an intelligent manner on an urban scale and then on a plot scale.
Here are some examples...

_Controlling the rising waters of the river: the municipality of Rotterdam has developed an adaptation strategy for more resilient water management in general._

_Controlling the trajectory of water: diagram of the water course of the Zac de Boulogne Billancourt by the TER agency through reservoir basins or the flow of water from the roofs of housing._

_Build on stilts: First there is the upper enclosure and then the stilts. Building at height has the advantage of adapting to many topographical and geographical conditions and in particular makes it possible to reduce the danger faced with floods._

_The floating structure: The floating structure is mounted on an aluminum platform with hard plastic floats._

_The amphibious house: The lower part of the house lies flat on a tray. In the event of rising water, thanks to the buoyancy of the archimedes the water will slide under the house towards the basin, which will make the house go up, maintained by rails. The house is moored, the electrical conduits and conduits follow the movement of the water._



This research was an opportunity for me to increase my knowledge of resilient projects in a fluvial environment to better live in a flood area like in Ile-de-France.
With the evolution of factors like that of global warming, I understood that the context in which we develop our strategies requires permanent adaptation.
Through my final project, I want to integrate resilient developments at the urban scale as well as at the scale of the individual plot to allow an optimization of the built landscape in times of floods. I want to increase the safety of populations exposed to rising water levels by providing residents with a mixed program, complementary to the existing and innovative around smart urban infrastructure.


So in a second part I studied the risk of flooding in Île-de-France, and in particular on the site of confluence between the Seine and the Marne grouping the municipalities of Ivry-sur-Seine, Charenton-le- Pont and d'Alfortville. And faced with the plight of the inhabitants and in view of the rising waters, it was important for me to propose a final study project providing alternatives for better living with water so that it is no longer experienced as a confrontation, a constraint, something negative.

_If a centennial flood were to occur in Ile de France today, this would affect 435,000 homes, 100,000 establishments would be exposed, 830,000 people, as well as 750,000 jobs._

_The above document allows us to see, on the scale of Ile-de-France, the occupation of the municipal population in flood zones. We can see that the densest cities are also on the most floodable areas. These most populous municipalities are also the most exposed and are unsuitable in the face of a potential flood._

_At all times, the centennial flood of January 1910 is the most significant with a height close to 9m. Here is the Seine bed for a 100 year flood._

_Industrial space also remains one of the most significant components of the Seine thanks to its flow of goods, people, boats, energy, primary materials and water treatment. The Seine and the two confluences of the Marne and the Oise favor the territorial interface and are two strategic poles. This is why I want to invest for my diploma project this site of confluence between the Seine and the Marne around the municipalities of Ivry-sur-Seine, Charenton-le-Pont and Alfortville. This territory reveals real potential for transformation. An urban project on this site will allow me to create new relationships between municipalities. It is a question of making existing and industrial heritage coexist with new urban challenges._

The double challenge is to connect the river banks in the urban space between Ivry-sur-Seine, Charenton-le-Pont and Alfortville by maintaining the contribution of the port area to current metropolitan economic functions. Before, the banks represented rather a rupture in the city, notably marked by the motorways. Today I understand that these spaces on the banks of the Seine make it possible to set up a new urban model linking the banks to the city._

_I will focus later for my end of study project on this strategic pole of this territorial interface between the Seine and the Marne in order to create a cultural center, notably around the rising waters._
